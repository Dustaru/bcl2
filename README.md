### Project BCL2 revival:

Uniprot FASTA sequences for 

	1. BCL2 family (Pore formers, Antiapoptotic members, BH3-only members), 
	2. Inhibition of Apoptosis proteins (IAPs)
	3. Proteins showing significant sequence or BCL2-like fold similarity, with or without activity
	4. Virus and worm BCL-2 homologs
	5. A little on mitochondrial-remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins

Restarted literature collection on BCL2.
